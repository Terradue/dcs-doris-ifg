Data preparation
================

The data preparation step foresees to copy test data to the sandbox, and register it in the sandbox's local catalogue service. 

The application uses Envisat ASAR Image Mode Single Look Complex (ASA_IMS_1P) data. ESA provides access to thousands of SAR products via the EO Virtual Archive 4 (also available in the Geohazards Exploitation Platform). 

The following section shows how to copy the test data on the sandbox's local storage and register it on the sandbox's local catalogue. 
The same techniques can be applied with the other OpenSearch catalogues.
 
Copying test data on your Sandbox
*********************************

The sandbox includes a catalogue service exposing the OpenSearch interface. 
A Web Client is available at http://localhost/catalogue/sandbox for interactive search and retrieve tasks.
At initialisation, the sandbox contains no data, so clicking on the Search button will not return any results.

You will use the ciop-catcp [#f1]_ utility to copy both the data and metadata from a source catalogue. The source catalogue that we consider here is Terradue's Cloud Platform catalogue, containing a subset of the Envisat MERIS mission. 
The ciop-catcp utility takes an OpenSearch URL and a few options to optionally copy the data and register the metadata.  

The ciop-catcp utility relies on ciop-copy, a utility to stage-in data to the sandbox from a myriad of data repositories.

The EO Virtual Archive 4 uses ESA's EO Single Sign-On (EO-SSO) to control the authentication of data requests. In order to use ciop-copy and thus ciop-catcp, you have to initialize the credentials on your sandbox home folder.
  
On the sandbox' shell, run the command below making sure to replace the place holders with your EO-SSO credentials:

.. code-block:: console

  echo "eo-sso-idp.eo.esa.int=<your EO-SSO username>:<your EO-SSO password>" > .ciop-copy_cred 

On the sandbox' shell, run the command:

.. code-block:: console

 ciop-catcp -m byval "http://eo-virtual-archive4.esa.int/search/ASA_IMS_1P/rdf//?startIndex=0&q=ASA_IMS_1P&start=1992-01-01&stop=2015-02-01&bbox=12.3,41.5,15,43.2&track=%5B129,129%5D"

This will take the Envisat ASAR Image Mode Single Look Complex (ASA_IMS_1P) acquisitions over the Italian city L'Aquila available on the EO Virtual Archive catalogue and copy them to the local sandbox filesystem and catalogue. The operation can take a few minutes. Then you will get a message about the dataset being successfully registered in the local catalogue.

To check the registered data and verify its accessibility, go back to the sandbox catalogue Web Client, and click the 'Search' button. The graphical interface will show the data now available locally to the sandbox.

Click on one product from the list on the left, and then on the Access tab below the map.

Finally click on the related HTTP URL. The download of the selected MERIS Level 1 product starts.

Copy the link to the selected MERIS file, go back to the sandbox shell and type

.. code-block:: console

 cd 
 ciop-copy -o ./ http://localhost/data/ASA_IMS_1PNDPA20080326_204749_000000162067_00129_31746_3124.N1

This will copy the locally registered ASA_IMS_1PNDPA20080326_204749_000000162067_00129_31746_3124.N1 product in the Sandbox' home folder.

The ciop-copy [#f2]_ utility does more than simply copying HTTP URLs, it can also consume the catalogue entry RDF URL as input. 
Go back to the catalogue Web Client, and click on the Metadata tab, and then on the RDF logo:

  The Sandbox catalogue interface tab for product metadata

This will open the ASAR product catalogue entry in the RDF format. Copy that URL in order to use it as argument to ciop-copy:

.. code-block:: console

 cd
 ciop-copy -o ./ http://localhost/catalogue/sandbox/ASA_IMS_1P/ASA_IMS_1PNDPA20080326_204749_000000162067_00129_31746_3124.N1/rdf
 
Once the download is completed, the MERIS product is available in your /home folder. The same strategy is adopted when copying a file from the storage in a run executable.

 There is now some test data on your Sandbox!
