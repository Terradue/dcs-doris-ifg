===============================================

This application generates interferogram(s) using one master and one or more slave products with the Doris InSAR processor developed by the Delft Institute of Earth Observation and Space Systems of the Delft University of Technology.

This application relies on ADORE that stands for Automated DORIS Environment. ADORE development started at the University of Miami Geodesy Group to help researchers generate interferograms with ease.
