Addressing a scientific / processing goal
=========================================

This application processes pairs of Envisat ASAR Level 1 (ASA_IMS_1P) master/slave product with Doris to generate interferograms.

The Delft Institute of Earth Observation and Space Systems of Delft University of Technology has developed an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processor named Doris (Delft object-oriented radar interferometric software).

Doris is invoked using ADORE - Automated Doris Environment. Its development started at the University of Miami Geodesy Group, to help researchers generate interferograms with ease. Just like Doris it is an open source project and it comes with the same license. ADORE tries to provide a streamlined user interface for generating interferograms with DORIS and has some additional features for displaying and exporting the results, and time series analysis.
